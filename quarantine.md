# This Quarantine life.  All of the recipes


I don't know about you, but I gained the quarantine **20**, I think I saw it somewhere written as "How to not gain the quarantine 15", but 5 lbs per month seems right.  We started in March, then carried to April... May... June... 

When we have nothing but time on our hands, I looked for things to do to keep my hands busy. I did the 1 puzzle I had saved in my house. Now what? Tear it apart and do it again? No. This is how my life turned into adventures in baking, cooking and mixology. 

We had just landed in Athens on March 11, 2020 when we found out that our tour had been cancelled. (No prior notice from the tour company, but that's another ordeal itself!)  We had about 24 hours before we had to turn around and come home to Pennsylvania. Luckily for us, the hotel we were transferred to had a restaurant with a rooftop bar and view of the Parthenon.  It may have been our only real dinner in Greece, but it was fantastic.

If I had known that would be my last dinner in a restaurant in the month of March, and for the next 4 months, I may have gotten dessert! 

We arrived back in DC to a new world. Masks weren't yet a mandate, but it seemed that many people were now in quite a panic.  We were met with new paperwork to enter the country. CDC guidelines and wellness checks.  We were given the greenlight to go home and self quarantine for 14 days. If we had any symptoms, we were to alert the health department right away. 

We made it home, but we were now faced with a new challenge.  An **Empty** Fridge!   

I try to use everything in our pantry and fridge before going on a vacation. Prior to us leaving, I used up most of our canned goods and everything in our fridge that would have went bad before we came back - I don't like to waste food.  This now had me worried.  I had seen some of the media coverage of crowds panic buying at the grocery store.   I made it into the grocery store and saw all of my usual go tos- GONE. 

Yeast - GONE.
Flour - GONE.
Chicken - GONE.
Lettuce - GONE.

and don't get me started on toilet paper.  

I bought what I could, without being a nutcase.  I was going to have to get creative.   I've always been someone that soothes myself by baking or cooking.  Meal prepping on Sundays - namaste.  

With my anxiety climbing, I knew I wanted to get in the kitchen and calm those thoughts. It calmed me to cook for my family. Trying out new things and regions within my own home helped make me feel less quarantined. Here are a few of my family's favorite recipes from quarantine.  

 * Quiche - with roasted tomatoes
 * Pappardelle Pasta with Bolognese
 * Sprinkle Cake - with pb filling & chocolate icing - Birthday in Quarantine!
 * Cheesesteak galette
 * Shortbread cookies
 * Tahini Sesame cookies
 * Almond Biscotti
 * Mac n Cheese with crispy parsley
 * Dumplings - so many dumplings
 * Empanadas 
 * Brioche buns
 * Greek fries
 * Chimichangas
 * Tortilla chips & guacamole
 * Focaccia bread - (leftovers turned into meatball sandwiches)
 * French rolls - (leftovers turned into smoked chicken sandwiches)
 * Cinnamon raisin bread - (leftovers turned into french toast)
 * Sfeeha with feta & tzatziki sauce
 * Strawberry oat bars
 * Copycat Panera salads
 * Scones... oh so many sconey-scone-scones

I'm sure we're not done with that list, but as you can see - that's where that 20 pounds came from.  

oh... I almost forgot - My drinks!  I became a master at using what alcohol, fruit and mixers we had in the house to make some of the best frozen mugs i've ever had.
