# Epcot's Food & Wine 2019

If we're already going to be in Orlando during the festival and we have a free day - let's try some of the awesome dishes available during the 
[Disney's Food and Wine Festival!](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/epcot/food-wine-marketplaces/) 
I've only been to Epcot once. It was in 2016 and over the Fourth of July weekend. **Big Mistake.** 
Between dealing with the lines from every member of every family *ever* being on vacation and wiping the sweat from the 110 degree heat off my forehead - It was a miserable first time.

 My husband bought us tickets as a birthday gift to help me on [my mission to drink a beer from every state.](https://www.wanderinglush.com/2017-05-20-untappd-data/) but I found it to be rather difficult to keep up with all of the professional drinkers already doing the same thing.  This time, It will be all about trying the different cuisines!
