I have been on the receiving end of some pretty nice and thoughtful gifts, but more often than not, I have to just regift things I've received. *(Sorry friends and family, I'm allergic to shellfish - so a crab claw cracker set isn't needed in my house!)* 

This year for my birthday, I wasn't taking any chances.  

I invested in some shares of **BREWDOG** for myself!  

As an [Equity for Punks Shareholder of BrewDog](https://www.brewdog.com/usa/equityforpunks) I get some pretty awesome perks that I wish I had known about before traveling to 2 of their world pubs this year: 

 * A 5% discount in all of the bars, all around the world
 * A 20% lifetime discount on the BrewDog USA shop, which stocks tons of awesome merch
 * A free tour of BrewDog Columbus
 * A free tour of BrewDog Ellon
 * An invite (and a plus one) to the amazing USA AGM; our annual, soon-to-be-legendary beer, music and food festival, exclusively for shareholders
 * Access to the exclusive shareholder forum & community, www.equitypunks.com
 * An Equity Punks ID Card
 * A say in how the company is run!

I am stoked to have found this awesome opportunity to be a part of an awesome brewery that I believe in!

Stay tuned for my updates as I put my shares to good use! Cheers!
