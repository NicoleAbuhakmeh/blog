<p>Lately, when i’ve been following my GPS directions to a new brewery, I question if i’m in the right place. Traveling to<em><strong> Lost Rhino</strong></em> was one of those times. It had been on my radar to check out for about six months. But I had to wait until I could include it in a full weekend roadtrip down to Virginia. Traveling down Route 15, I turned towards the airport and into a business center in Ashburn, Virginia.  I looked up after parking in the business lot and saw a few gentlemen carrying growlers in.  That was all the more information I needed to know I was in the right spot.</p>
<p>The name<strong><em> Lost Rhino</em></strong> had an appeal to me, that I can only describe as innate. Maybe it was my love for the animal from my first childhood experience at the Zoo or maybe it’s my boyfriend’s experience in working with RavenDB which is a product of <a href="http://HibernatingRhinos.com" title="http://hibernatingrhinos.com/" target="_blank">Hibernating Rhinos</a> - either way, I knew I had to visit. </p>
<p>The day we visited they had over 10 fresh offerings, all locally crafted, and the beer was excellent. My sampler on this day included: </p>
<ul><li>RhinO’fest</li>
<li>Steampunk</li>
<li>Holy Brew Honey Blonde</li>
<li>Holy Brew Brown</li>
<li>Tropical Thunder</li>
<li>New River Pale Ale</li>
<li>It’s Not My Falt</li>
<li>Face Plant</li>
<li>Final Glide</li>
