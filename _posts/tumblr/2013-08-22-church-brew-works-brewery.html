<p>Church Brew Works sits in a renovated church just outside of the city in Lawrenceville. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what to expect when I opened the door, but was pleasantly surprised when I did.  They didn&rsquo;t renovate the structure of the church it&rsquo;s self, just re-purposed the old building to fit their needs. The pews were shortened to become seating for diners. Leftover pews were fashioned into a bar to serve Church Brew Works crafts.  By far the best part of the renovating was making the Alter where most of the brewing of the beer is done.  </p>

<p>We went to the church on Sunday (something you won&rsquo;t hear me say often) and got to experience another unique part of their dining menu.  They have a chef&rsquo;s creative day menu on most Sundays. You can pick a protein, (I went with salmon) pick a style, (I went with asian) and tell them anything you don&rsquo;t like. The chef then creates you something unique from that structure for your meal. I got a Honey-Soy Grilled Salmon with Sliced Red Beets over Pilaf.  It was a risk for me as I usually play it safe with something I know i&rsquo;ll like.  Overall it was a t<span>ruly a unique experience.  </span></p>
