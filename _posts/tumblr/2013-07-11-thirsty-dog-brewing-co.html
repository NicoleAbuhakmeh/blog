<p>Thirsty Dog Brewing Co. in Akron, OH was definitely a sight for tired road-tripped eyes. Tucked away on the outskirts of downtown Akron in a humble slightly industrial area, is Thirsty Dog&rsquo;s recently expanded brewery and newly opened taproom.  The only sign that we were in the right place was the mini grain silo with the Thirsty Dog logo on it!</p>
<p>The taproom is in the middle of the brewery which gives you a great sense of beer in every direction.  We were there on a late Friday afternoon just to squeeze in a few samples or a fresh pint, so we didn&rsquo;t get to experience any real brewer action.  The production and shipping were in full force though.  </p>
<p>No real sampler as of yet can be had in their recently added Taproom, but you can order as many smaller oz glasses as you&rsquo;d like. On this day I had:</p>
<p>Labrador Lager</p>
<p>Raspberry Ale</p>
<p>Old Druid Bloodhound Saison</p>

<p>Thirsty Dog is a mid-west staple, and slowly making it&rsquo;s name on the east coast with their very popular Old Leghumper.  If you find yourself in the area, stop on by this up and comer.  Especially if you love dogs. </p>
