<p>Starr Hill Brewing Company might be tucked away in the middle of Virginia but it has great star power to bring beer lovers to their wonderful brewery from near and far.</p>
<p>I first learned of Starr Hill about 2 months prior to my visit when they made the distribution reach into the Central Pennsylvania area with The Love and Northern Lights. </p>
<p>Making the trek down via Skyline Drive we made it to the brewery just after they opened, but the parking lot was packed like they had been open for hours. </p>
<p>Starr Hill checks your ID and charges $5 at the door for a full tasting of their selections. The bartenders are friendly and helpful with any questions regarding their beers or brewery. It doesn&rsquo;t make for a great picture when they serve you one at a time in a plastic cup, but I enjoyed my time at Starr Hill.  </p>

<p>Northern Lights</p>
<p>Boxcarr Pumpkin Porter</p>
<p>The Love</p>
<p>Grateful Pale Ale</p>
