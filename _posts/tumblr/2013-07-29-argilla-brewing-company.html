<p>I depend on my Foursquare app (<em>maybe a little too much!</em>) to point me in the direction of my next beer/brewery. Sadly my iphone battery doesn&rsquo;t always love it, but I do!  Foursquare didn&rsquo;t disappoint on my recent trip to Newark.  On a rainy Sunday I searched for a brewery near our hotel and it pointed me to a pizza shop that brews their own beer.  Back home we have one of these Pizza/Brewpubs (@AlsofHampden / @pizzaboybrewing ) and it&rsquo;s my go to favorite, so I wanted to test Pietro&rsquo;s Pizza on their brews.   Confession: Anytime I have pizza, I tend to feel as if i&rsquo;m cheating on Al. So I went for something off the wall for a pizza place - Fish Tacos. They made this amazing chipotle cream sauce for over the fish. This made my day.  So the food was hit - Now on to the real test. </p>
<p>Argilla says they are the smallest brewery in the state of Delaware, producing <span>1.5 Barrels. Since they are, they have &ldquo;The </span>luxury of experimenting quite often.&rdquo; Sitting at the bar I could see them tinkering around in the back with their fermenter. This made it all feel quite homey for me. You can tell they love what they do and are proud to serve it to you.</p>
<p>Argilla has only 7 taps. 6 for their brews and 1 for a guest tap.  Not as many as I had hope for, but my liver may have been thankful. </p>
<p>My Argilla sampler included their:</p>
<ul><li>ESB</li>
<li>British Brown</li>
<li>Cream Ale</li>
<li>D.I.P.A.</li>
<li>Avoine</li>
</ul><p>They had just kicked their: If you don&rsquo;t know, now you Simcoe.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>All are very tasty, but th</span><span>e cream ale was my favorite out of the 5.</span></p>
<p><span>Give them a try on your next roadtrip to the beach!</span></p>
