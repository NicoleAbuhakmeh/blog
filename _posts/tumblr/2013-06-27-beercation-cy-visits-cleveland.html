<p><em><strong>Cleveland Rocks! Cleveland Rocks! </strong></em><em><strong>Cleveland Rocks! Cleveland Rocks! </strong></em></p>

<p>Ok, Now that i&rsquo;ve gotten that finally out of my system, let&rsquo;s talk about the awesomeness that is Cleveland&rsquo;s beer scene. Driving on an early Friday, my goal was get to Akron around lunch time with the first stop being Thirsty Dog&rsquo;s brewery. </p>

<p><em><strong>(Thirsty Dog in Akron, OH!)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Thirsty Dog</strong> had about 10 beers on tap- which makes the brewery/taproom a must for any Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper fan! <em>(Please read about our whole visit under the Thirsty Dog beer photo!)</em></p>
<p>Special thanks to Mr. Hero (<em>Never had one before heading into OH!</em>) for a special road trip lunch, after we realized Thirsty Dog didn&rsquo;t have food. </p>
<p>When traveling, I try and keep my brewery stops to a 2-3 per day maximum for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>But Cleveland had a lot that I needed to take in.  We did the usual touristy stuff&hellip;</p>
<ul><li><span>Superman house <em>(just ok)</em></span></li>
<li><span><span>Christmas Story House <em>(better)</em></span></span></li>
<li><span>Indians Game </span><em>(I&rsquo;m a Yankees Fan but I miss Nick Swisher!)</em></li>
<li><span>Lake Erie at sunset </span><em>(beautiful)<img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/b36e825aa09ee547e2ff982034710255/tumblr_inline_mp27cvjIr61qz4rgp.jpg"/></em></li>
<li><span>West Side Market </span><em>(crazy busy, but great food)<img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/e44c819c5f8f55fa02ec599d563c01aa/tumblr_inline_mp27a78fTT1qz4rgp.jpg"/></em></li>

</ul><ul><li><span><span><em>Rock N Roll Hall of Fame (worth it once, especially if it had a special Rolling Stone exhibit &amp; Michael&rsquo;s Glove)</em></span></span></li>
<li><em>The Arcade hotel building and East 4th Street</em></li>
<li><em>Tower City (lit up in Superman Colors was very neat - but night time doesn&rsquo;t make for the best picture taking)</em></li>
</ul><p><span><em>and a few other architectural highlights, but back to the real highlights of our beer-cation&hellip; Breweries and Food!</em></span></p>
<p>We took in a late dinner at <strong>Melt</strong> - the Grilled Cheese Super Restaurant!  Yum, stay with the standard hot sandwiches though, the peanut butter and banana one sounds tasty but it just turns into a mushy mess.  They havd quite a few mid-west beers on tap along with some local favorites - I went with Chicago Revolution Brewing Co.&rsquo;s Bottom Up Wit &amp; Indiana&rsquo;s Three Floyds Brewing Co.&rsquo;s Gumballhead. </p>
<p><strong>Great Lake&rsquo;s Brewing Co</strong><span>.&rsquo;s line was out the door - and since we&rsquo;ve had their beers before, we skipped over to </span><strong>Fat Head&rsquo;s Brewery &amp; Saloon</strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fat Head&rsquo;s Brewery &amp; Saloon</strong> has 12 of their own brews on tap and a few other local taps, but if you&rsquo;re going to take the time to seek out a brewery -definitely try theirs.  <em>(Please read about our whole visit under the Fat Head&rsquo;s Brewery &amp; Saloon beer photo!)</em></p>
<p>I kept hearing about <strong>Grumpy&rsquo;s Cafe, a</strong><span></span><span> great local breakfast spot. According to the food and the 25+ minute wait - it was worth a visit. The cajun home-fries hit the spot!</span></p>
<p>We checked out the 10 local brews at <strong>Rocky River Brewing Company</strong>. <span> </span><em>(Please read about our whole visit under the Rocky River Brewing Co. beer photo!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Geraci&rsquo;s - </strong>was mentioned on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives as a Cleveland staple, so of course we had to go check them and their &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; pizza pie out. There was a very familiar yet different taste to their small pizza. *editors note* It tasted like Pizza Hut - mystery flavor solved. </p>
<p><strong>The BottleHouse Brewing Co </strong>was our final Cleveland brewery to check out. This place was tucked away in the Cleveland Heights was a brick building with video games and communal tables inside and about 4 tables outside on their sidewalk space. This was ideal as I was there for the beer and it gave my beer&rsquo;d out traveling partner something to do while I enjoyed my 6 piece sampler. <em>(Please read about our whole visit under the BottleHouse Brewing Co. beer photo!)</em></p>
<p><strong>B Spot Burger&rsquo;s.</strong>  This place was amazing. We amazingly caught a late lunch right as happy hour was starting. Happy Hour in Ohio is a lot happier place than I thought it ever could be. It starts around 3pm with dollar Lola Fries (yes.), all burgers were $5 (go for the Thin Lizzy), and $3 draft beers, (yup, even those special - run you about $8 anywhere else special pours) also with happy hour are brats and wine.  Our bartender was extra special. Courtney saw I was drooling over their 23+ draft list and decided she&rsquo;d just bring me a bunch of local favorites to try. This was truly a girl after my own heart. I sampled/drank: </p>
<ol><li><span>Bam Biere - Jolly Pumpkin</span></li>
<li><span>Blanche de Bruxelles - Brasserie Lefebvre</span></li>
<li><span>Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale - Fat Head&rsquo;s Brewery</span></li>
<li><span>N'ice Chouffe - Brasserie d'Achouffe</span></li>
<li><span>216 Dry Hopped Session Ale - Portside Distillery</span></li>
<li><span>Reissdorf Kolsch - Privat-Brauerei <em><strong>*favorite!</strong></em></span></li>
<li><span>4 C&rsquo;s American Pale Ale - The Brew Kettle</span></li>
<li><span>Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale - Lexington Brewing Co.</span></li>
</ol><p><span>What a delightful place <strong>Michael Symon</strong> has here! If you&rsquo;re ever near a B Spot Burger&rsquo;s - you have to pop in, even if it&rsquo;s not during their happy hour. </span></p>
<p><strong>Heinen&rsquo;s Fine Foods </strong>should be your go to place for carry out beers and other local favorites. Please look them up if you&rsquo;re in the area. We came back with a few favorites not being enjoyed in our local PA area yet. <strong>Indigo Imp Brewing Co</strong>, was on our list to get to, but time did not allow, so we brought a case home. Next time <strong>Cleveland</strong>. Next Time. </p>

<p><em> I do suggest a trip to Cleveland, I had my hangups about visiting because everyone stated it could be a scary place. The strange thing was, that once we got there and started walking around there was this great sense of pride radiating from the people of Cleveland. They love their city. and now I do to.  I can&rsquo;t wait to go back. <strong>&lt;3 CY, Nikki</strong></em></p>
