<p>Back in August I took a road trip down to check out a few of the brewery offerings in Northern Virginia or NoVa for the locals.   Our first stop of the day was in Leesburg.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vintage 50.</em></strong></p>
<p>It was neatly tucked away behind a strip mall off the main road. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect walking in through the lobby doors of a business center, but then as we turned the corner into the brewery the hops hit me nose and I knew we were in the right place.  The restaurant has an outdoor seating area that seems like it would be the perfect place for an blowing-off-steam-after-work Happy Hour or inside the grand bar area for a more upscale event. </p>
<p>I decided to kick off my tasting with a sampler of: </p>
<ul><li>Old Carolina Roggen</li>
<li>Duex Mois Biere De Garde (Top Notch!)</li>
<li>Anonymous Dampf</li>
<li>50 CAT IPA</li>
</ul><p>After we put in our order- I moseyed on over to take a peek inside the brewhouse, (it’s slightly quartered off from the restaurant) and I met Vintage 50's Brewster Bret Kimbrough.  </p>
<p>One of the best parts of writing about craft beer is meeting the people behind it. I love when it works out that I can visit a brewery on a weekday. Watching them do what they do and seeing the pride they take into the beer they craft makes me even prouder to buy it. </p>
<p>Over the smell the chocolate and coffee brewing in the background for their Percheron Porter, Bret welcomed us to the brewery and told us a little about what they had going in fermentation next.  I was sad to have missed any of their darker beers being available on tap, but then again it was the middle of summer. Then again, it can&rsquo;t be just me that likes a good<em> Stout</em> on a hot summer day, can it?</p>
<p>Take in a visit to Vintage 50 the next time you&rsquo;re around the area. </p>
