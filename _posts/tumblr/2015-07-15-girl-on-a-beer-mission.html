(I’m looking at you Alabama.) </p><p>Being the data nerd that I am, I knew I would need to some how get my data from untappd to a map. I set about in the old fashion way of going page by page of my history.  That’s when my <i>amazing boyfriend Khalid, </i>told me he could build me a little something to make my life easier. <a href="http://www.khalidabuhakmeh.com/my-girlfriend-is-a-lush-and-i-have-the-data-to-prove-it" target="_blank">(Read more about that here!)   </a> </p><p>I had done some traveling and tried to manually keep track of the beers states I was knocking off, but it’s not that easy some times - especially after a few sampling flights. </p><p>Fast forward 9 months of paper tracking and trying to remember if I had this state or not when I was bootlegging beer back home.  The gods at Untappd must have heard my pleas to add an excel column to the export with the brewery’s address/state - because now as a supporter you have the ability to export that exact information! <a href="https://twitter.com/gregavola" target="_blank">Greg </a>- You’re awesome. </p><p>I am almost there. 9 more states to go!  These last few are proving to be tricky. Rhode Island should have been crossed off on my New England Beercation but we somehow missed that state, I know we travelled through it to get to Cape Cod. Peter Griffin, I’ll be back to drink your beer! </p><p>But the last few remaining are Rhode Island, Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico, South and North Dakota. </p><p>The map at the top shows all that is left to complete on my mission. </p><p>Just a few left. Com’on Mr. Liver - get in the car - we have some states to visit! </p>
