<p>2013 has been reserved for taking more road trips to visit great beer cities nearby and later this year, farther away. </p>
<p>Pittsburgh was calling my name for a few reasons, many surrounding the Pirates. They are finally having a winning season! They also acquired one of my Yankees favorites from last year - Russell Martin! The other reasons all centered around trying new beers. </p>
<p>We kicked off our road trip by packing up the car with a few essentials for bringing back our beer finds. Cooler, Cooler bag and a large air tight container for any brewing supplies. I tended to want to be over prepared in any case when it comes to my beer transporting. </p>
<p>We arrived just outside of Pittsburgh in Monroesville at our first stop of the day, <strong>Rivertowne Pour House</strong>.  Now this little gem was well off the beaten path but everyone and their mama raved about their pineapple beer and food. Up until last year I wasn&rsquo;t fond of fruit in my beer, <em>(unless you&rsquo;re counting pumpkin as a fruit, in that case i&rsquo;m guilty of liking it)</em> I&rsquo;m still not a fan of cherry anything, but pineapple i&rsquo;m willing to try.  We ordered our sampler and a few &ldquo;try-it&rsquo;s&rdquo; of some not included in the sampler. <em>(Read more about our visit under the post: Rivertowne Pour House)</em> Lunch overall was pretty tasty. </p>
<p>With food out of the way for our first half of the day, we set about to find the next brewery on the list. <strong>Full Pint Brewing Co</strong>. After 3 U-turns and a few yells at the GPS, we had to ultimately give up our hunt for visiting them. Turns out it&rsquo;s a little hidden up on a hill from the main road with no easy access.  Always next time. </p>
<p>Trying to limit my daily brewery visits to 3 when traveling is hard when there are so many I have to visit in such a short time. I knew I had to save my third of the day (really it&rsquo;s my second since the hunt for the Full Pint was a bust, but..) for the best&hellip; <strong>Penn Brewery</strong>. </p>
<p>There are really 2 driving season in Pennsylvania - Winter and Construction. Getting to Penn was also going to be a challenge with all of the highway construction on the North Shore. Anyone that&rsquo;s ever driven in Pittsburgh will agree that the highway system is a nightmare. You enter on the left, have less than 100 ft to merge and then boom your exit is on the right. Terrifying. Luckily most Yinzers are amazingly nice when driving through the city. Every now and then you have your Jag-offs, but for the most part it&rsquo;s pretty road rage free. </p>
<p>When we got the Penn Brewery it was just as the label on their Penn Pilsner shows, grand and vintage. One warning to any sampler lover, be prepared for the size of the sampler. It&rsquo;s the largest sample of beer i&rsquo;ve received. Anywhere. <span> </span><em>(Read more about our visit under the post: Penn Brewery)</em></p>

<p>Having gotten all the brewery trips of the day out of the way, it was time for some baseball. </p>
<p>PNC Park is one of the nicest ball parks in the MLB. It has a brewpub, great views of the city beyond the river and craft beer! What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>

<p><span>Another highlight of this wonderful city is it&rsquo;s native son - Andy Warhol&rsquo;s Museum. I&rsquo;d been the city several times growing up, but only a handful of times as an adult. I&rsquo;d started my year trying to put a strikethrough items on my YOLO (yah, I hated it too, but once they sang about it on SNL, I warmed to it) bucket list.  Visiting the Warhol has been on it since I saw my first PopArt piece as a teenager. It didn&rsquo;t disappoint. We were there just in time to see their visiting exhibit: </span><span>Genesis Breyer P-Orridge: S/HE IS HER/E. </span></p>

<p><span> One complaint I always get when traveling with a group is that aren&rsquo;t enough scheduled stops for eating. I tend to forget to schedule in those little details. This time I did not. Pittsburgh has a strip district with delicious street vendors.  My favorite thing about the strip district is all of the Steeler&rsquo;s gear for sale. I couldn&rsquo;t resist picking up a few new terrible towels. </span></p>
<p><span>Friend&rsquo;s of mine insisted we stop by a friend of theirs business: <strong>Wigle Whiskey</strong>. This was my first time in a craft distillery. Mary Ellen is the mama of the family company and quite the hostess. </span><em>(Read more about our visit under the post: Wigle Whiskey)</em></p>

<p>As we wrapped our weekend in Pittsburgh we stopped in to a church. <strong>Church Brew Works Brewery</strong>! Beer as a religion, that&rsquo;s my kind of thing.  I can&rsquo;t suggest visiting this beautifully converted church enough. <em><span>(Read more about our visit under the post: Church Brew Works Brewery)</span></em></p>
<p><span>With our weekend in the Steel City winding down, we took one last walk along the river. The crowd cheering at PNC park let us know the pirates won. The fireworks startled us as they started to go off on a barge in the river. Point Park&rsquo;s fountain was lit up a </span>spectacular<span> blue in the distance just as the Mt. Washington incline was climbing and everything just felt grand in this city. </span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;ve always loved Pittsburgh for it&rsquo;s sports teams, but now I appreciated it for it&rsquo;s culture almost as much.</span></p>
