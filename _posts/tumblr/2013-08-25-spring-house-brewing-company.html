<p>On a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon I decided to trek to downtown Lancaster city to visit the company that makes the delicious Big Gruesome Chocolate Peanut Butter Stout. As soon as we turned the corner of King Street, I knew we weren&rsquo;t the only ones that had a craving for their brews. The taproom was packed. We luckily scored a table in the back, ordered a sampler and a few favorites for the table to share. The taproom is on the smaller side, but offers a few tables of sidewalk seating and even has a few daily sandwiches available to order.  </p>
<p>Our sampler on this Saturday included all 9 of their available brews. (We opted to not include the guest tap.)</p>
<ul><li>Neil Saison</li>
<li>Daphne Rustic Farmhouse Saison</li>
<li>Diabolical Dr. Wit</li>
<li>Goofy Foot Summer Wheat</li>
<li>Blood Lust</li>
<li>Beyond the Gates DIPA</li>
<li>Seven Gates Pale Ale</li>
<li>Big Gruesome Chocolate Peanut Butter Stout</li>
<li>Braaaiins! (Awesome Pumpkin flavor this year!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit their taproom at:</p>
<p>25 West King Street</p>
<p>Lancaster, Pa 17603</p>
