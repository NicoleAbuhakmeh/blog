<p>Penn Brewery on the North side of Pittsburgh is one of those must visit institutions of beer brewing. It&rsquo;s set up on the hill top of Vinial Street with a great view of Pittsburgh. Penn Brewery also goes by Pennsylvania Brewing Company. No matter the name, the beer is still essential Pittsburgh.  German style beer with pure Pittsburgh heritage food make this brewery a great brewpub. I suggest getting the Pierogi of the day with a side of beer cheese to round out your sampler. </p>
