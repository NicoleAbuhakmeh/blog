<p>Devils Backbone Brewing Company Basecamp Brewpub in Roseland, VA was our 1st stop along the Nelson 151 Brewery Trail. They have a grand resort style &ldquo;basecamp&rdquo; restaurant and brewery set up. From the parking lot area I could see they had a stage area beginning to be built for outdoor events.</p>
<p>The real reason we were there was to give their 2012 Great American Beer Festival winning beers a try. </p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s sampler included: </p>
<p>Schwartz Bier</p>
<p>Striped Bass Pale Ale</p>
<p>Black Rock Milk Stout</p>
<p>White Stag</p>
<p>Hazy Summer</p>
<p>Old Virginia Gold</p>

<p>My favorite was the Schwartz Bier, it paired really well with my delicious pulled pork sandwich. </p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;ve gotta get there early enough to get the chocolate crunch torte before they sell out. </p>
