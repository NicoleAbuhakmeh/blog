<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to Pittsburgh, you have to try this Pineapple Beer from Rivertowne.&rdquo;  Now like I said in my Pittsburgh Beercation post, Up until last year I wasn’t fond of fruit in my beer or even fruit flavored beer.  I had my reservations for sure, but I&rsquo;m also not one to turn down trying any beer i&rsquo;ve never had before. <span></span></p>
<p>Rivertowne has several locations in and around Pittsburgh. Since we were going for food and beer we decided to give the Monroeville Rivertowne Pour House a go. If you go, order a cheese &amp; steak stromboli to go with your own sampler. <span><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<p>Most of the locations carry between 14-18 beers. I made my own sampler of 8 of their best. </p>
<ul><li>Red, Red Raspberry Ale</li>
<li>Hefeweizen</li>
<li>Old Wylie&rsquo;s IPA</li>
<li>Grateful White</li>
<li>Hala Kahiki Pineapple Ale</li>
<li>RT Lager</li>
<li>Maxwell&rsquo;s Scottish Ale</li>
<li>Babbling Blonde</li>
</ul><p>I need to return to get some of their seasonal brews. I love a good Milk Stout afterall! </p>
