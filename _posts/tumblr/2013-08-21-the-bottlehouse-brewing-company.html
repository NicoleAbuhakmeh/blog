<p>The BottleHouse Brewing Company in Cleveland Heights is a nicely designed indie bar with a nice game room set up on one side with vintage arcade and pinball machines opposite the bar. The overall feel of the space is sparse. There are a few tables with board games sitting on them to give you something to do with friends while you share a pint of their house beers. On a few nights a month they also have open mic and stage events.  On the Sunday I was there it was just the bartender and my group inside, everyone else was out of the patio enjoying their samplers.  </p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s sampler included all but 1 of their house drafts for the day: </p>
<ul><li>Northcoast IPA</li>
<li>Cedar Hill Hefeweizen</li>
<li>Easy Drinking Pale Ale</li>
<li>Golden Belgian</li>
<li>Summer Camp Kolsch</li>
<li>Milk Stout</li>
</ul>
