<p>Iron Hill Brewery is a 10 brewery &ldquo;chain&rdquo; in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. This was my first visit to any of the locations. On this day, Newark was having an around the town walking tour for food and beer pairings that Iron Hill was participating in.   This was our first stop for the tour but upon seeing the list of other beers being served around we decided to make this our sampler stop. </p>
<p>Iron Hill has a head brewer at each of their locations. According to our server, it creates a bit of competition among the locations and even has a title for the winner of Iron Brewer.  This makes me fear a chain restaurant a little less when they have different beers at each location. </p>
<p>Iron Hill Newark brought the flavor in their sampler! <span>It included:</span></p>
<ul><li>Iron Hill Light Lager</li>
<li>Vienna Red Lager</li>
<li>Raspberry Wheat</li>
<li>Pig Iron Porter</li>
<li>Ironbound Ale</li>
<li>Belgian White</li>
<li>Bavarian IPA</li>
<li>Hefeweizen</li>
<li>Cask Conditioned Anvil Ale</li>
</ul><p>Don&rsquo;t fear the chain when it comes to any Iron Hill location!</p>
