<p>Bad Wolf Brewing Company was our last stop on the first day of our NoVa/Central Virginia Beercation.  </p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if I was going to be able to make it inside the small retail front shop to taste <strong>Bad Wolf&rsquo;</strong>s unfiltered and unpasteurized beers.  The small space they have as a taproom was packed!  This was a good sign, even if it made it difficult to get into the space and order a sampler.  </p>
<p>Bad Wolf&rsquo;s set up is that of a <span>one barrel brewery. It&rsquo;s nice because that means there is always something new on tap. Their six taps on this day included: </span></p>
<ul><li>Loveless Brown Porter</li>
<li>Malupa Milk Stout</li>
<li>Citra Saison</li>
<li>Citra Gold</li>
<li>Ruinator IPA</li>
<li>Bernis Imperial Stout</li>
</ul><p>Someday I will learn that I don&rsquo;t need to try every single beer a brewery has on tap. Some day. </p>
