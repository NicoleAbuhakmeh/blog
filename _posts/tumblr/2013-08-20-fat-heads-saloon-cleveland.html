<p>A nice highlight of my June trip to Cleveland was Fat Head&rsquo;s Saloon.  You&rsquo;ve seen their logo around - Fat faced, big headed bald guy with mustache, sunglasses and depending on the season or style of beer he might be wearing a santa hat or a german alpine hat. </p>
<p>This beer is widely loved in the Great Lakes - Western Pennsylvania area. I&rsquo;d heard about it, but never really experienced it until heading to their saloon. I&rsquo;m glad I waited until getting to the mothership to taste their craft brews. </p>
<p>The set up isn&rsquo;t all that original for the restaurant and typical brew-pub fair, but the sampler was really grand. </p>
<p>My beer list for my trip to the saloon included: </p>
<ul><li>Oompa Loompa Chocolate Cream Stout</li>
<li>Tibetan Tribal Tripel</li>
<li>Google Fogger Hefe Weizen</li>
<li>Nuke Proof Wheat Wine</li>
<li>Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale</li>
<li>Starlight Lager</li>
<li>Duke of Lager Fest Bier</li>
<li>Head Hunter IPA</li>
