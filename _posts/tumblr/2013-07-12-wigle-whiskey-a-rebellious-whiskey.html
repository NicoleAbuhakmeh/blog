<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Strip District is bringing back the tradition of craft distilling!  </p>
<p>Wigle Whiskey and it&rsquo;s unique story are where it&rsquo;s starting! Western Pennsylvania was once known for it&rsquo;s famous Monogahela Rye Whiskey.  </p>
<p><span>Wigle&rsquo;s website states they are  &quot;</span><span>A grain-to-bottle Distillery, we ensure freshness by milling the grains onsite the same day we start a batch and distill in small batches in a traditional copper pot.&ldquo;  </span><span>And folks it&rsquo;s the truth!</span></p>
<p>Distillery Mom, <span>Mary Ellen loves telling the Wigle story and how it came to be on a family winery trip to Niagara on the Lake. She gets a gleam in her eye as she talks about her children and the dedication they have put in to their carefully selected local, organic grains and process.  They mill ingredients on site and distill each batch. </span></p>
<p>We stopped in on a rainy sunday afternoon, having missed the Saturday tour, we were still invited to have a look around the working operations. </p>
<p><span>I asked her about the name, not realizing the rich Pennsylvania history behind it. She explained how Pittsburgh was home to the Whiskey Rebellion, which Phillip Vigol (and later Wigle!) helped to foment when he defended his right to distill in a tussle (punched and burnt his house down!) with a tax collector and was sentenced to be hung for treason. Basically he was being forced to pay a new tax for using leftover grain to create whiskey and was not too happy about that.  The rebellion ultimately pitted western Pennsylvania distillers against George Washington&rsquo;s troops. Washington ultimately pardoned him. The Wigle logo shows the g as a noose with Washington and Wigle having a drink underneath the man-less noose after Washington pardoned Wigle. </span></p>
<p><span>Drinks made with their whiskey are available but we wanted to try a full flight to get the full experience. The sampler/flight included:</span></p>
<p>White Wheat Whiskey</p>
<p>White Rye Whiskey</p>
<p>Aged Whiskey</p>
<p>Ginever</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not normally a whiskey person, but the Ginever was right up my alley. It is a pre-prohibition style gin, meaning it was made with whiskey that was gently distilled 3 times with a blend of botanicals. I ended up making this my own drink with some ice cubes and a few drops of water. </p>
<p>The White Wheat Whiskey was sweet on the tongue.  Wigle states it is twice distilled from a mash of local, organic wheat and malted barley.</p>
<p>The White Rye Whiskey had a spicier taste, with the addition of a local organic rye. </p>
<p>The Aged Whiskey had spent some time in their &quot;Lickety Split Aging Kit Barrel&rdquo; and had taken on a bit of the oak barrel flavor and color.</p>
<p>The <span>&ldquo;Lickety Split Aging Kit Barrel&rdquo; are a wonderful DIY at home aging kit. They have 2 sizes - 1 liter and 2 liter barrels. </span></p>
<p><span>Wigle Whiskey is getting quite a following locally also. Many restaurants in and around Pittsburgh are carrying their products and they can be ordered through the Pennsylvania State &lsquo;Fine Wine and Good Spirits&quot; stores.</span></p>
