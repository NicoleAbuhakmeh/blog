<p>This past weekend I made it a mission to visit 2 of the breweries I&rsquo;ve been missing out on located in the outskirts of Philadelphia. Thunderstorms nor flash flooding was going to stop me on this mission.</p>
<p>Sly Fox was the first on the list. I love taking roadtrips. But when Beer is involved it becomes a Beercation - no matter the length of time spent away from home. This beercation involved visiting breweries in Delaware and Pennsylvania.  </p>
<p>Sly Fox is tucked away in a little strip mall in Phoenixville. Since it is widely distributed in my area, I&rsquo;ve had a few of their cans, even a few of the topless 360 cans of Helles Golden Lager.  This was my first sampling of a few of their main stream brews though. </p>
<p>They serve their samplers on a neat little tray. I love a brewery that knows how to serve a sampler. <img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/24d81b6d94a77c76f6f2e9d4c12d4e37/tumblr_inline_mqttncVFTO1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>They had about 15 beers on tap, but with my previous experience with Sly Fox, I tried to get things out of my reach!</p>
<p>My sampler on this day included:</p>
<ul><li><span>Wegman&rsquo;s Summer IPA</span></li>
<li><span>Grisette</span></li>
<li><span>Saison Vos</span></li>
<li><span>O'Reilly&rsquo;s Stout</span></li>
<li><span>Phoenix Pale Ale</span></li>
<li><span>Chester County Brown</span></li>
</ul><p><span>I had a great first visit to Sly Fox, next time I&rsquo;ll leave room for some items off their menu.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit them!</span></p>
