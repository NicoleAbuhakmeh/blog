<p>As a child I remember taking road trips with my grandparents.  Mostly it was always a surprise to my grandma and I.  My Grandpa had this travel bug in him and we were always on the go.  I was too young to remember most of those trips now. All except 2. Driving down the Skyline Drive in Virginia sticks out in my mind. (The other one is visiting Niagara Falls and Canada for the first time, but i&rsquo;ll save that for another post.)</p>
<p>Last year I saw an episode of BBC TopGear when they came to drive Skyline Drive in their super sports cars. They were annoyed with the speed limit being 35 MPH. I laughed at their annoyance - until I actually drove the road myself. I&rsquo;m a bit of speed demon. It&rsquo;s beautiful scenery but maybe 45 MPH would be more appropriate. </p>

<p>I suggest a drive from beginning to end on Skyline at least once in your life. There are parts where you drive through the clouds to places were the sun shines down on a deep river valley.</p>
<p><span>My real purpose of this trip was to get a visit in with Starr Hill Brewery, Devils Backbone Brewing Company, Wild Wolf Brewing Company and Blue Mountain Brewery. I had been to Central Virginia before, but didn&rsquo;t really get to experience the craft beer culture. </span></p>
<p><span>The whole Skyline drive takes over 5 hours start to finish.  The great thing about visiting National Parks is that the admission fee you pay is usually good for up to 7 days. We took advantage of that to break our trip up into 2 days. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://WWW.starrhill.com" target="_blank">Starr Hill</a> is just outside of the up and coming tech hub of <span>Charlottesville. <img alt="image" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/ee677e94b5e7903d1c2bdcbe214451fe/tumblr_inline_mtshyj2mDp1s28olo.jpg"/><br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>We got there just in time to for the release of their Pumpkin Porter. (Read more about Starr Hill in the brewery post with the same title)</span></span></p>
<p><span>The rest of my breweries on this trip are part of a a beer trail called </span><span>&ldquo;</span><a href="http://www.Nelson151.com" target="_blank">Nelson 151</a><span>&rdquo;. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.dbbrewingcompany.com" target="_blank">Devils Backbone Brewing Company</a> was our stop for dinner. It was sitting majestically at the bottom of the Shenandoah Valley and had some interesting </span>taxidermy<span> decor on the inside. As we sat down, I saw someone point above my head and laugh from across the room - I looked up and this was what I saw&hellip;  </span></p>

<p><span>This freaked me out at first, but ultimately I laughed and enjoyed the rest of my time at Devils Backbone. </span><span>(Read more about Devils Backbone in the brewery post with the same title)</span></p>
<p><span>We rounded out our day with a nightcap at <a href="http://www.wildwolfbeer.com" target="_blank">Wild Wolf Brewing Company</a> which ended up being less 2 miles away on the trail.  This local watering hole turned out to be it&rsquo;s own little oasis. It had a small shopping village with a waterfall and Koi pond, restaurant &amp; sports bar besides the brewery. One of the shops was a true homebrewers paradise. After we picked up a few items for our next home brew (aptly titled Va-Va Brown, based on our purchases) we took some seats near the brew house and got to know the locals. There are times when i&rsquo;m visiting somewhere that I feel competition among the brewers of the area and get a sense of condemnation if I mention that I plan on checking out another place while i&rsquo;m in town visiting. The bartender as Wild Wolf couldn&rsquo;t have been more helpful when I asked her about my next stop. She said that Blue Mountain would be the perfect stop for a Sunday morning brunch and suggested I order a local cider to go with it. </span></p>
<p>Wild Wolf had a sense of humor to go with their delicious brews. </p>

<p>Sunday morning we ventured over to our last stop on the trail -<a href="http://www.bluemountainbrewery.com" target="_blank"> Blue Mountain Brewery</a>. It turned out to be a pretty perfect Sunday morning to sit outside and watch the clouds roll off the mountain and enjoy their crafts.  <span>(Read more about Blue Mountain Brewery in the brewery post with the same title)</span></p>
<p>With the weather being the right combination of humidity and mountain chill we decided to drive the whole Skyline Drive back towards Pennsylvania and enjoyed some awesome scenery, mountain top butterfly fields and even some local VA craft beers. </p>
