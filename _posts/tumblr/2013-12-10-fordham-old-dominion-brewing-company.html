<p><span>&ldquo;They can only say No.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the lesson i&rsquo;ve learned in 2013. Well, that and to stop being afraid of rejection. Maybe that&rsquo;s a little deep for a brewery post, but it fits for this occasion.</span></p>
<p><span>I tend to pack my roadtrips with all the breweries in the area. </span><em>I want to try them all</em><span>.  Recently on a trip down to Punkin-Chuckin&rsquo; weekend in Delaware, I put Fordham - Old Dominion Brewing Company on my must visit list.  </span>Unfortunately<span>, I found out they would be closed during the time I was passing through. This is where the awesome staff of their brewery stepped in and told me just to say the time I would like to come in and they would be there to greet us. (Thanks Twitter, owe you one!)</span></p>
<p><span>Not only did they have their tasting room open, but Eric the tasting room manager gave us a private tour.  I was really blown away by their </span>hospitality.  We got the back story of the 2 breweries becoming 1 in 2007, How they have a huge following in England- thanks to the exporting of their year round staples, and sampled some tasty brews including:  </p>
