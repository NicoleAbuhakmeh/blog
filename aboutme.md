# Things to know about me 

- My passion is traveling. It's what drives me and gets me through my downtimes. Pretty sure my Grandfather is the reason I can't sit still. 
- I am on a search to find the best sour beers this world has to offer.
- My home office is filled with trinkets that I refuse to part with from our travels including a voodoo doll from cajun country, wooden tulips from Holland, lava rocks from Iceland and seashells from the Caymans. 
- "Nothing compares to the excitement of exploring every corner of the earth with the person you love most by your side." Thankful I've got [My husband](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh) with me to figure out this path. 
- I make my living in educational software development, on the business side. Someone has to write the documentation, right?!
- I am owned by a big headed pup named Samson. He's adorable and boy does he know it!
