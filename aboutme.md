# Things to know about me 

- I live to travel. It's what drives me and gets me through my downtimes. 
- I am on a search to find the best sour beers this world has to offer.
- Life is too short to not have purple/blue mermaid hair, even if my teenager doesn't think it's cool.
- [My husband](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh) is my rock & superhero. We met when I happened to break his code while QA-ing. ;)
- I make my living in software development, on the business side. Someone has to write the documentation, right?!
- I am owned by a big headed pup named Samson. He's adorable but a power chewer. Nothing is safe with this guy around.
