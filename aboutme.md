# Things to know about me 

- My Passion is traveling. It's what drives me and gets me through my downtimes. 
- I am on a search to find the best sour beers this world has to offer.
- Life is too short to not have purple/blue mermaid hair, even if my teenager doesn't think it's cool.
- [My husband](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh) is my rock & superhero. 
- I make my living in educational software development, on the business side. Someone has to write the documentation, right?!
- I am owned by a big headed pup named Samson. He's adorable and boy does he know it!
