- My passport is my most prized possession. It's my license to explore the world!

- I've recently found an aerial yoga class near me and - I LOVE IT!

- I am on a search to find the best sour beers this world has to offer. [Find me on Untappd - nicoleabuhakmeh](http://untpd.it/u/Nicoleabuhakmeh)

- My teenager [Bryn](https://www.instagram.com/bbbrrryyynnnnnn) is finally understanding that there is a world out there beyond Snapchat! Her passport has 3 stamps and more pending!

- My home office is filled with trinkets that I refuse to part with from our travels including a voodoo doll from NOLA, wooden tulips from Holland, lava rocks from Iceland, seashells from the Caymans and an ostrich eggshell from South Africa.

- "Nothing compares to the excitement of exploring every corner of the earth with the person you love most by your side." Thankfully I've got [My husband, Khalid](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh) with me to figure out this path.

- I make my living in educational software development, on the business side. Someone has to write the documentation and test the code, right?!

- These two are my furbabies. Samson and Guinness aka Lil' G. Samson is my big mastiff english bulldog mix and Lil' G, well he's a Heinz 57!  We believe he is part beagle, shar pei, hound and general monster.
