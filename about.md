### Experience

* Planned and traveled through Germany, France, Luxembourg, Italy, Japan, Canada, Iceland, Jamaica, Alaska and most of the other 48 states


### Remember
* Kayak will be your best friend and worst enemy.
* Don't always trust Priceline to think about your needs.
* Iceland is amazing, but don't expect Wifi or good weather.



### The Name
Wanderlust & Beer. Travel & Ale. Journeys & Flights. Two words that just seem to fit together for a happy life.
